# Test scenarios for business profile completion
echo "
📋 Test Scenarios:
1. Incomplete business profile should redirect to /dashboard/profile
2. Complete business profile should allow access to other dashboard sections
3. ProfileGuard should check business.is_profile_complete status

🔍 Key Components to Verify:
- backend/accounts/models.py: BusinessProfile.is_profile_complete()
- backend/accounts/views.py: Uses UserSerializer (with isProfileComplete)
- backend/accounts/serializers.py: UserSerializer includes isProfileComplete field
- frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx: Sets isProfileComplete for business users
- frontend/src/components/ProfileGuard.tsx: Checks business user profile completion

📊 Business Profile Required Fields:
- name (business name)
- category 
- address
- business_location_latitude & longitude
- city
- business_phone

✅ Recent Changes Applied:
- ✅ UserSerializer now used in _serialize_user_with_absolute_image
- ✅ AuthContext updated to handle business isProfileComplete
- ✅ AuthContext sets businessProfile data
- ✅ BusinessProfile interface updated with all fields
- ✅ ProfileGuard checks both customer and business profile completion

🚀 Testing Instructions:
1. Start backend: cd backend && python manage.py runserver
2. Start frontend: cd frontend && npm run dev
3. Register new business user
4. Try to access dashboard sections (should redirect to profile)
5. Complete all required business fields
6. Verify access to other dashboard sections is allowed

🔧 Debug Commands:
- Check business profile in Django admin
- Console log user.isProfileComplete in browser
- Verify API response includes isProfileComplete field
